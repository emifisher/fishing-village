# fishing-village
personal website

my first project -- a personal website to display some of my information, interests, work (music/writing) and to use as a project for learning to write HTML and CSS.
I am a complete beginner at all of these things (and github). but yeah. i don't think anyone will see this but if you do and want to reach out to me for some reason
i am available on twitter (@emi_f1sher) and email: emifisher@protonmail.com.
the site is currently being hosted at fishingvillage.neocities.org. thanks.
